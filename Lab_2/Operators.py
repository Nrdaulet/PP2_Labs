# Python Arithmetic Operators

# Python Assignment Operators
x = 5

x *= 3

# Python Comparison Operators
x = 5

# Python Logical Operators
x = 5

print(x > 3 and x < 10)

# Python Identity Operators

print(x is z)

# returns True because z is the same object as x

print(x is y)

# returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content
